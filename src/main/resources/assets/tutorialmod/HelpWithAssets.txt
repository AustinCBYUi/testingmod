Always need to go through the items here, textures always has to be added. Block textures and item textures are different.

If doing a block, need to do blockstates, the lang for when it is in your inventory, the models>block for the game itself,
and the model>item which is also for the inventory for players. Finally, inside of the textures you must add the .png files to
the textures in the block folder.

If doing an item (I believe it will be specific to individual items like the Ruby tutorial,) you surely do the same.
Add the item to the lang en_us.json file (same thing as a classname basically), then add the item into the item folder as
a json, this will specifiy where to point textures to. Lastly, add the texture to the item folder.
