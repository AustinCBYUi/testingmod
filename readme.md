**Idea**

Further expand knowledge in Java and systems for modifying games.
Additionally I just really want to add stuff to Minecraft for fun :)

**---- Roadmap ----**

Upgrades to the End and end-game loot. Hopefully this mod will produce a 
compilation of content between overworld, nether, and end. I have plans to
develop this mod with original game content in mind, so things should be well
balanced. For instance, instead of adding the ability to make a full-auto M4
I will instead maybe add sulfur and gunpowder crafting to create black powder which of 
course would then be combined with 'steel' (maybe 1 iron ingot and 1 copper ingot creates steel, which 1 steel
bar creates 5 steel shots/balls.). In turn you have created black powder ammunition for
single shot weapons that produce high damage. (e.g. Flintlock, Blunderbuss of the sorts.)

For sure additions will be:
- **Ender bow** and **Ender Claw** (Ender bow is obtained by crafting with two Ender Claws from new NPCs near End Cities.)
- **Crossbow** that competes with the Bow with Power V. I like the idea of having a round loaded at all times instead of pulling on the bow.
- **Rare Ore** found only in the End which would be used to craft the new **Crossbow**.
- **Bolts** instead of arrows for said crossbow. Created via same **ore** exclusive to End.
- *Firearms possibly.* This would be loaded like the Crossbows, but probably way slower.(Sulfer and Steel would be introduced.)
- **Food** products will be a for sure addition at some point.

That's all I can think of at this point in time. Of course with all of my documentation I'll add a proper tracker here with Added, fixed, removed. Thanks!
